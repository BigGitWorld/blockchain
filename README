In this project, try to realize a basic version of blockchain with c/java/c++  (to be determined later)

Some basic resource:
1. If use java, then there are some libraries that we might need to take into consideration.
	BitcoinJ
	Web3j
	HyperLedger Fabric
But things come to be a bit easy in java...
